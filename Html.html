    <h1>Introduction of HTML</h1>
    <p>It seems like there might be a typo in your question. If you meant to ask about HTML, it stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web. It's the building block of web pages and is used to structure content, such as text, images, links, forms, and other elements, on a webpage.

        HTML uses a system of tags and attributes to define the structure and presentation of content on a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and usually come in pairs, with an opening tag and a closing tag</p>
