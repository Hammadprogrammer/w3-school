    <h1>Introduction of CSS</h1>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG or XHTML). CSS defines how elements should be displayed on a web page, specifying the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects.

        CSS allows web developers to separate the structure and content of a document (handled by HTML) from its presentation and styling. This separation enhances the maintainability and flexibility of web pages, making it easier to update and modify the appearance of a website without altering its underlying structure.
        
        CSS uses a syntax with selectors and declarations. A selector is used to target HTML elements, and a declaration block contains one or more declarations that define the style rules for the selected elements. Here's a simple example:
        
        css
        Copy code
        /* CSS stylesheet */
        body {
          font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
          background-color: #f0f0f0;
        }
        
        h1 {
          color: #333;
        }
        In this example:
        
        body and h1 are selectors targeting the <body> and <h1> HTML elements, respectively.
        Inside the curly braces {}, you have declarations specifying the style rules.
        Each declaration consists of a property (e.g., font-family, background-color, color) and a value (e.g., Arial, sans-serif, #f0f0f0, #333).
        CSS can be included in an HTML document
